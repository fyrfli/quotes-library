~~# Reading json and randomly posting content

I wanted to create an "app" that would read in JSON and print out the results randomly based on a randomly generated number. It took me a while to get right, mostly because of the JSON file format. I have it down now. This is my result.

This started out as a looping display of random quotes and evolved to be just one large grid with all the quotes. It's getting to be a pretty large page so the next step for this is to make all items the same size with a "more..." indicator that when clicked will open up a css popover with the full quote and an "X" to close.
